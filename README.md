# Advent of Code - Learning Rust

## Why?

I've been wanting to learn a new language, and I'd pared it down to:

- Elixir - Functional, and approaches I've seen look very clean for solving problems. Gateway drug to Erlang, which I'd also like to learn.
- Rust - Low level, compiled, fast. I've heard the borrow-checker can be cruel. Good packaging and toolchain.
- Go - Google hype train, but I've messed around with it a little in the past and it looked nice. Looked good for simplifying threading with channels.

I really like Python and TypeScript, so I'm hoping to find another language that feels comfortable.. but I really wanted the language to be:

1. Compiled - I have never worked with a language that compiles to binaries, so I want to try that.
2. Strong types - Since switching from JavaScript to TypeScript, I've found that I REALLY like leveraging the compiler and language server for safety, especially when it can help you prevent null-pointer-style errors.
3. Speed - I've done a little C programming the past, which ran fast.. but in recent years, I've primarily been using interpreted languages, which just come with overhead.
4. Threading - Python has the GIL, and I believe JavaScript has something similar (there may be implementations that don't.. and ServiceWorkers), but I've never really dipped my toes into actual threads before.

For all the above, Go and Rust felt like the two I might want to go for-- and I've had no experience in Rust.. so why not?

## Learning

I'm using this as an opportunity to try something new, get frustrated, yell, and then try again until I succeed.

I'd appreciate any feedback on my code, because I 100% admit that I am approaching my solutions from my background of Python and TypeScript-- so there might be a more Rust-like approach that would be a lot cleaner.
